## Typography

- **Headlines:** Inter or Outfit, bold, uppercase, tight letter-spacing
- **Body:** Same family, regular weight, normal case
- **Sizes:** Responsive — large hero headline scaling down for mobile

## Page Structure

The page is a single HTML file (`index.html`) with seven sections, top to bottom.

### Section 1: Hero

- **Headline:** Bold, large, uppercase. Example: "THE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR YOUR SOCCER CLUB"
- **Subheadline:** One sentence. Example: "Built for Directors of Coaching to run their entire club in one place."
- **Email capture:** Input field + CTA button ("Join the Waitlist")
- **Background:** Subtle animated grid or pitch-line pattern using CSS (no heavy JS libraries)
- **Layout:** Centered, vertically stacked

### Section 2: Problem Statement

Three pain-point cards displayed in a horizontal row (stacks vertically on mobile):

1. "Drowning in parent emails"
2. "Juggling 5 different apps"
3. "Coach coverage chaos"

Each card has:
- An icon (SVG or emoji placeholder)
- A short headline
- One sentence of supporting text

Cards use `#12203A` background with subtle border or glow on hover.

### Section 3: Feature Highlights

Six feature blocks displayed in a 2x3 or 3x2 grid (responsive):

1. **AI Communication Hub** — Emails, messages, and chats centralized. Common questions answered automatically. Urgent issues highlighted.
2. **Automated Scheduling** — Practices, games, cancellations, and changes pushed instantly to coaches, players, and parents with built-in maps.
3. **Coach Coverage System** — Coaches mark unavailability. System finds qualified replacements automatically. DOC has full visibility.
4. **Player Development Profiles** — Positions, performance data, highlights, and voice-to-text coach feedback stored per player.
5. **Camp & Revenue Tracking** — Active, upcoming, and completed camps with registration counts and revenue tracking over time.
6. **Parent & Player Portal** — Clean, simple access to schedules, chat, travel info, camps, and attendance confirmation via push notification.

Each block has:
- An icon
- A bold title
- 1-2 sentence description
- `#12203A` card background

### Section 4: How It Works

Three-step horizontal flow (stacks vertically on mobile):

1. **Set up your club** — Add teams, coaches, players, and schedules
2. **System runs in the background** — AI handles communication, coverage, and notifications
3. **You focus on coaching** — Less admin, more development

Steps connected by a visual line or arrow. Each step has a number, title, and one-line description.

### Section 5: Who It's For

Three tiers displayed visually (cards or columns):

1. **Director of Coaching** — Full control. Centralized dashboard, voice-enabled commands, complete club visibility.
2. **Coaches** — Team-level access. Schedules, player profiles, attendance, availability management.
3. **Parents & Players** — Simple experience. Schedules, chat, attendance confirmation, camp info, travel recommendations.

Visual hierarchy should emphasize DOC as the top tier (largest or most prominent card).

### Section 6: Final CTA

- **Headline:** Example: "Be the first to run your club smarter"
- **Email capture:** Same input + button pattern as hero
- **Supporting text:** Example: "Join the waitlist. Early access coming soon."

### Section 7: Footer

- SidelineOS logo/wordmark
- Copyright line
- Placeholder social media icon links (no actual links needed yet)
- Minimal — one row

## Interactions & Effects

- **Smooth scroll:** CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` with optional nav anchor links
- **Card hover:** Subtle lift (`translateY(-4px)`) and/or green glow (`box-shadow`) on feature and problem cards
- **CTA button:** Electric green background, dark text, glow effect on hover (`box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,255,135,0.4)`)
- **Hero background:** CSS-only animated grid pattern or subtle pitch lines (keyframe animation, no JS dependency)
- **Scroll fade-in:** Sections fade in on scroll using `IntersectionObserver` (vanilla JS)

## Email Capture

- For MVP/waitlist phase: form submits to a simple endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a future backend)
- Input validation: basic email format check in JS before submit
- Success state: inline confirmation message replacing the form

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop:** Full-width sections, multi-column grids
- **Tablet:** 2-column grids collapse where needed
- **Mobile:** Single column, stacked layout, adjusted font sizes
- **Breakpoints:** 768px (tablet), 480px (mobile)
